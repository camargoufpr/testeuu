00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:06,495
Hello. 
In this video, we'll continue to consider 

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:10,130
some summary measures we can use when 
exploring a dataset. 

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,700
This time, we'll go to the data provided 
by our anthropologist. 

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,340
Here, we're trying to estimate age at 
death from skeletal remains. 

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,682
And in this video, we'll in particular 
consider the method of the [UNKNOWN]. 

6
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:25,310
We're intrested in how well this method 
works. 

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,203
So, we'll consider the difference between 
the estimated age, based on the skeleton, 

8
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:35,730
and the actual age at death for the 400 
skeletons in our dataset. 

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,800
We'll begin with a look at a box plot of 
these data. 

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,404
Although there are some positive values, 
we can see that most of the observations 

11
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:46,520
are negative. 
In fact, because the third quartile is 

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,850
negative, we know that more than three 
quarters or 75% of the data are negative. 

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,840
So, the method of [UNKNOWN] tends to 
underestimate the age of death. 

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,950
It's also possible with this method to be 
way off from the actual age. 

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,330
Note that the minimum value is negative 
60. 

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,204
Meaning for one of the observations, the 
estimate was 60 years younger than the 

17
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:14,394
actual age. 
We may want to investigate how unusual 

18
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:19,847
this value of negative 60 is. 
A modified box plot is one way to do 

19
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,360
this. 
Modified box plots were designed to 

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,850
detect unusual observations. 
To draw one, we first calculate the 

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,990
interquartile range or IQR. 
This is the difference between the third 

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,901
and first quartile. 
For these data, the third quartile is 

23
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:42,85
negative 5 and the first quartile is 
negative 23, the difference is 18, so the 

24
00:01:42,85 --> 00:01:49,30
interquartile range is 18. 
We then locate the inner fences, which 

25
00:01:49,30 --> 00:01:54,559
are designed to contain most of the data. 
The inner fences are the values that are 

26
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:59,705
1.5 times the IQR beyond the first and 
third quartile. 

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,110
For the lower inner fence, then we 
calculate the first quartile, negative 

28
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,210
23, minus 1.5 times the interquartile 
range, 18, which gives us negative 50. 

29
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,282
Similarly, for the upper inner fence, we 
calculate negative 5 plus 1.5 times 18 

30
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:24,670
and get 22. 
In a modified box plot, the whiskers 

31
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,134
extend to the observations that are 
closest to the fences but still within 

32
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,742
them. 
Values outside the fences are indicated 

33
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:35,900
individually and are worthy of some 
attention, particularly isolated values 

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,614
that are far outside the fences. 
We can see that our minimum value of 

35
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:46,554
negative 60 is outside the inner fences 
but there are also other observations 

36
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:50,284
beyond the fences. 
So, perhaps in underestimate of 60 years 

37
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:55,210
is part of the range of values that might 
be observed with the[UNKNOWN] method. 

38
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,890
Here's a quick summary on how to instruct 
a modified box plot. 

39
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,200
It can help us both summarize the data 
and detect some possibly unusual 

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,675
observations. 
Here's the five-number summary again for 

41
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:11,502
our data. 
The median is a measure of the center of 

42
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:14,575
the data. 
Another common statistic used to capture 

43
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:17,851
the center of the data is the mean or 
average. 

44
00:03:20,40 --> 00:03:23,440
We'll introduce a bit of mathematical 
notation here. 

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,770
The Greek letter, capital sigma, is used 
in mathematics for sum. 

46
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:34,700
The mean is the sum of the data values 
divided by the number of data points. 

47
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,799
Suppose we have n data points, for our 
example, n is 400, the number of 

48
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,0
skeletons. 
Let's represent our data values as x 

49
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:49,304
subscript 1, x subscript 2, through x 
subscript n. 

50
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:53,462
The subscript is an index for the 
position of the data value in the 

51
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,275
dataset, and n is the number of data 
values. 

52
00:03:56,275 --> 00:04:01,154
The mean is given the symbol x with a bar 
over it. 

53
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:07,253
And the formula for the mean is the sum 
sigma of the x's, from the first 

54
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:12,990
observation to the last, divided by the 
number of data values n. 

55
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:18,855
For the differences between the estimated 
and actual ages for our 400 skeletons, n 

56
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:23,955
was 400, the median, as we saw, is 
negative 13 and the mean for this data is 

57
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:28,738
negative 14.2 . 
Notice that the mean is more negative 

58
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:33,799
than the median for this data. 
This happens because the mean is pulled 

59
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:39,330
down by the unusually large negative 
observations we observed here. 

60
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,820
We say that the mean is not a robust 
statistic. 

61
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,474
That is, it is not resistant to extreme 
observations. 

62
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:51,150
In contrast, the median is a robust 
statistic. 

63
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,926
Changing the values of the extreme 
observations does not change the value of 

64
00:04:54,926 --> 00:05:00,536
the middle observation. 
Suppose we wanted to limit the influence 

65
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:05,513
of the extreme observations on the 
calculation of the mean, one option is to 

66
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,866
use a trimmed mean. 
To find a 10% trimmed mean, delete the 

67
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:13,24
largest 10% and the smallest 10% of the 
data, and then take the average of the 

68
00:05:13,24 --> 00:05:18,836
remaining observations. 
For these data, we remove the 40 largest 

69
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:24,150
and smallest data values, and the 10% 
trimmed mean is negative 13.8. 

70
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,180
Note that the trimmed mean is closer to 
the median than the mean, as the trimmed 

71
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,720
mean is more robust to extreme 
observations than the mean. 

72
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,50
As an illustration of the robustness of 
the median and trimmed mean versus the 

73
00:05:39,50 --> 00:05:43,991
mean, let's look at a smaller data set. 
Here are the salaries in US dollars 

74
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:48,494
announced in May, 2012, for the 25 
players on the New York Red Bulls, a 

75
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:54,341
soccer team in the MLS. 
I've put them in order, from smallest to 

76
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:57,581
largest. 
As is typical in the MLS, a few players 

77
00:05:57,581 --> 00:06:02,846
have very large salaries, while most of 
the players have salaries more in line 

78
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:07,427
with the average American. 
In particular, the salaries of Rafael 

79
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:12,490
Marquez and Thierry Henry, who had the 
largest salary in the MLS, are much 

80
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,712
larger than the salaries of their 
teammates. 

81
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:21,344
You can see just how unusual Marquez and 
Henry are by looking at a modified box 

82
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:25,326
plot. 
The box needed to be very compressed to 

83
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:29,920
fit them on the screen. 
Let's do some calculations. 

84
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,816
Since there are 25 salaries, the median 
is the 13th value in the ordered salaries 

85
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:41,448
which is about $112,000. 
For the mean, we sum the salaries and 

86
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:46,90
divide by 25 to get approximately 
$518,000. 

87
00:06:46,90 --> 00:06:50,445
We can see that the mean is much larger 
than the median because it is influenced 

88
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:52,922
by the large salaries of Marquez and 
Henry. 

89
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:56,780
If we want to remove their influence, we 
can use a trimmed mean. 

90
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,409
8% of 25 is 2. 
So, an 8% trimmed mean would remove 

91
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:08,730
Marquez and Henry as well as two players 
earning $33,750. 

92
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:15,9
The trimmed mean is the average of the 21 
remaining salaries and is about $128,000, 

93
00:07:15,9 --> 00:07:20,378
which is a value that is much more 
representative of the salaries of the 

94
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:23,983
rest of the team. 
Here's a summary of the measures of 

95
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:26,910
center, or location, that we've 
discussed. 

96
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,854
The median and the trimmed mean are 
robust against extreme observations, 

97
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,940
while the mean is not.
