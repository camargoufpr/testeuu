1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,898
Now that we've seen a few datasets and 
some of the summary statistics we can 

2
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:13,22
calculate and plots we can create in 
order to get and understanding of our 

3
00:00:13,22 --> 00:00:17,800
data, we'll now summarize some of the 
features of data in general. 

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,356
An observational unit is the person or 
thing on which measurements are taken for 

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,408
which a number of different terms are 
commonly used. 

6
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:30,100
Examples of observational units that 
we've encountered already include country 

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,452
or territory and our life expectancy 
data, skeleton in our anthropological 

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:38,951
data, and soccer player in the data of 
salaries of New York Red Bulls players. 

9
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:44,297
When we talk about a variable, we're 
talking about a characteristic that we've 

10
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:48,892
measured on an observational unit. 
In our life expectancy data, this 

11
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:53,250
includes, of course, life expectancy, as 
well as region of the world. 

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,290
In our anthropological data, variables 
include age at death, sex, BMI, the 

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,570
estimated age at death, the difference 
between the actual and estimated age at 

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,10
death, which is an example of a variable 
calculated from other variables, and the 

15
00:01:09,10 --> 00:01:13,789
salary of our soccer players. 
An observed value or observation is our 

16
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:17,184
data. 
It is the actual value of a variable for 

17
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:20,54
one of the observational units in a 
dataset. 

18
00:01:20,54 --> 00:01:26,258
Data are arranged in rows and columns, 
with one row for each observational unit 

19
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:31,80
and a column for each variable. 
Many different file formats are possible 

20
00:01:31,80 --> 00:01:34,414
for data, such as spreadsheets and comma 
separated values. 

21
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:38,494
If you explore the data files used in 
this course, you'll find that we're 

22
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:42,778
supplying the data in plain text files 
with spaces separating the observed 

23
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:47,96
values of the variables. 
Note, as here, that categorical variables 

24
00:01:47,96 --> 00:01:50,370
can be coded multiple ways, including as 
numbers. 

25
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,830
Here, a sex of 1 indicates a male and 2, 
a female. 

26
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:00,792
It's not a quantitative variable however. 
As we've already seen, variables can be 

27
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:05,62
of various types. 
A variable is quantitative if it takes on 

28
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:09,550
numerical values for which arithmetic 
operations make sense. 

29
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,450
For a quantitative variable, saying that 
one observation is twice as large as 

30
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,148
another, has a practical meaning. 
If one soccer player's salary, say, is 

31
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:20,950
twice that of another, that has a clear 
meaning. 

32
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,486
Similarly, saying one soccer player's 
salary is $10,000 more than another 

33
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:30,94
players has a clear mathematically 
precise meaning, regardless of how much 

34
00:02:30,94 --> 00:02:33,525
each soccer player earns. 
This is characteristic of a quantitative 

35
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:37,555
variable. 
Some examples of quantitative variables 

36
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:42,329
we've seen include life expectancy, the 
actual age of a skeleton at time of 

37
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:47,103
death, the estimated age for that 
skeleton, the difference between those 

38
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:52,396
two ages, the estimated and the actual 
age, and salary of the soccer players. 

39
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:57,20
A categorical variable records into which 
of several categories an observation 

40
00:02:57,20 --> 00:02:59,851
falls. 
As we saw in a previous video, we treat 

41
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:04,921
categorical variables with different 
summary statistics, such as relative 

42
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:08,920
frequency. 
Then, we use the quantitative variables. 

43
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,198
Some examples of categorical variables 
we've seen includes sex, which is 

44
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:16,881
categories male or female. 
BMI, when we consider it as the standard 

45
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:21,140
classifications of underweight, normal, 
overweight and obese. 

46
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,772
And region of the world which had six 
categories in our data. 

47
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:31,40
And finally, there are ordinal variables, 
which have a natural order. 

48
00:03:31,40 --> 00:03:34,884
Unlike quantitative variables, the 
differences between two values of an 

49
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:40,190
ordinal variable may not be meaningful. 
Sometimes, ordinal variables are treated 

50
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,200
as quantitative. 
But when doing so, we need to be careful. 

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,425
If the quantity like, say, the mean truly 
makes sense. 

52
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:51,182
However, if the median or middle value, 
typically does make sense for an ordinal 

53
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:56,190
variable. 
An example of ordinal variable we've seen 

54
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,750
is the BMI classifications. 
Since underweight is less than normal, 

55
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,680
which is less than overweight, which is 
less than obese. 

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,20
Another example of an ordinal variable is 
the response to a Likert item on a 

57
00:04:09,20 --> 00:04:13,570
questionnaire, where the respondent gets 
to choose from strongly disagree, 

58
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,530
disagree, and so on, up to strongly 
agree. 

59
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,820
In earlier videos, we talked about 
outliers and their effect on calculations 

60
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,173
of summary statistics. 
In the New York Red Bulls salary data, 

61
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:28,953
there were two players whose salaries 
were much larger than every other 

62
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:32,744
player's salary on the team. 
This happened as a result of the 

63
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:36,118
designated player rule. 
This is the defining feature of an 

64
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:39,646
outlier, that it is separated from the 
rest of the data. 

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,770
Outliers shouldn't be ignored or 
routinely removed from the data. 

66
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,760
It can happen that an outlier is a 
mistake. 

67
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,493
In a dataset of ages, say, an age of 555 
is clearly impossible and was likely a 

68
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,64
typo. 
Cleaning data by correcting errors like 

69
00:04:56,64 --> 00:05:00,610
this is an important first step in 
dealing with a new dataset. 

70
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,70
It's important to try to find out the 
reason for unusual observations. 

71
00:05:05,70 --> 00:05:09,294
When outliers are not mistakes, they 
might be the most interesting feature, 

72
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,808
and removing them would remove an 
important aspect of the data. 

73
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:17,351
But as we've seen in previous videos, 
they can sometimes have an overly 

74
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:22,356
influential effect on summary statistics 
that are not robust and they must be 

75
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:27,630
treated with care in the analysis. 
It's not unusual to report findings both 

76
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:35,760
with and without outliers. 
Sometimes, a dataset can include missing 

77
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,679
values. 
Observed values can be missing for a 

78
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:42,445
number of reasons. 
In the anthropology dataset of age 

79
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:46,865
estimates from skeletal remains, we've 
been looking at estimates of age at death 

80
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:49,326
which were taken using the DeGangi 
method. 

81
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:53,882
And the data we're using a random subset 
of skeletons chosen from those for which 

82
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:58,850
the first rib, which we need for the 
DeGangi estimate, was intact. 

83
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,344
It's possible for any skeleton, that the 
first rib might be missing or damaged so 

84
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:09,100
that a DeGangi age estimate cannot be 
made and the age estimate for the 

85
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,62
skeleton would be missing. 
Sometimes, the fact that a data value was 

86
00:06:13,62 --> 00:06:16,935
missing tells us something about what it 
would have been, had it been observed. 

87
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:23,143
Imagine a scale for measuring a person's 
weight that only goes up to, say, 100 

88
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:26,615
kilograms. 
Any larger subjects who were part of the 

89
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:31,150
study using this scale would have had a 
missing value for their weight. 

90
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,298
Not including them in the analyses would 
bias the results by, for example, having 

91
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:39,263
a mean weight that was smaller than the 
actual mean weight would have been, had 

92
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:45,368
the larger subjects been included. 
Or imagine a study where some subjects 

93
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:48,100
dropped out, because they weren't doing 
well. 

94
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,688
Carrying out analyses without these 
subjects would make us think that the 

95
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:56,100
subjects as a group did better than they 
actually did. 

96
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,705
These types of situations require a lot 
of care. 

97
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:04,639
For our skeletal remains, we don't expect 
that a missing first rib has any relation 

98
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,799
to the age of the skeleton at time of 
death, or to any other features of the 

99
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:14,730
skeleton, such as sex, or BMI, or to the 
estimate we would have got. 

100
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,284
It may be reasonable then to assume that 
excluding skeletons for which we have a 

101
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:23,493
missing value for the DeGangi age 
estimate doesn't have any effect on our 

102
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:27,520
analysis and we can continue to work with 
the dataset without them. 

103
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,339
But any time we encounter a dataset with 
missing values, we must consider 

104
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:37,316
carefully why they were missing, and 
whether the fact that they're missing 

105
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,730
might bias the results of our work.
